    "# Long Short-Term Memory Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. They are widely used in natural language processing (NLP) for tasks such as machine translation, speech generation, summarization, and dialogue systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Information Persistence and Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Human language relies on persistent structures: grammar rules, shared vocabulary, and the ability to interpret each word in context. As you read, earlier sentences influence your understanding of later ones — demonstrating long-term information retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks, inspired by the brain, initially struggled with such temporal relationships. Early models like perceptrons performed static transformations without memory, limiting their effectiveness on tasks requiring sequential reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern hardware enabled deeper architectures such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MLPs (Multi-Layer Perceptrons):** Stacks of perceptrons, effective for simple input–output transformations.\n",
    "* **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks):** Specialized for images, using filters that scan across spatial dimensions.\n",
    "* **RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks):** Designed for sequences, where each output depends on previous inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs “unroll” across time, producing hidden states that propagate contextual information forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Long-Term Dependency Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard RNNs struggle with long sequences due to vanishing and exploding gradients. They perform well when the relevant context is close to the prediction target (e.g., completing “The grass is always ___” → “greener”).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in sentences requiring distant context —\n",
    "*“It is winter… The grass is always ___.”* → “brown” —\n",
    "standard RNNs fail to preserve the necessary information across many timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is known as the **long-term dependency problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs were introduced to address these limitations. While maintaining the chain structure of RNNs, LSTMs replace the simple recurrent unit with a more sophisticated cell composed of multiple interacting components.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LSTM cell processes input using **four internal operations** controlled by gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forget gate:** Determines how much of the previous cell state to keep.\n",
    "2. **Input gate:** Regulates how much new information to write to the cell.\n",
    "3. **Candidate state:** Proposes new content to add.\n",
    "4. **Output gate:** Controls how much of the updated cell state forms the new hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cell State and Hidden State\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM maintains two vector states:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cell state** $c_t$: acts as long-term memory, carrying information across many timesteps.\n",
    "* **Hidden state** $h_t$: short-term output used for predictions and passed to subsequent layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core update equations (simplified) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_t = \\sigma(W_f[x_t, h_{t-1}] + b_f)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "i_t = \\sigma(W_i[x_t, h_{t-1}] + b_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tilde{c}*t = \\tanh(W_c[x_t, h*{t-1}] + b_c)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_t = f_t \\odot c_{t-1} + i_t \\odot \\tilde{c}_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "o_t = \\sigma(W_o[x_t, h_{t-1}] + b_o)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_t = o_t \\odot \\tanh(c_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These gating mechanisms allow LSTMs to preserve important information and discard irrelevant details as sequences evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why LSTMs Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "By blending persistent memory with selective updates, LSTMs excel at:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Capturing long-term patterns\n",
    "* Modeling contextual relationships over extended text\n",
    "* Generating coherent sequences\n",
    "* Handling variable-length inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "They remain foundational components in many deep learning systems, even as newer models (like Transformers) gain prominence.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs provide a robust solution to the limitations of traditional RNNs, enabling machines to leverage distant context much like humans do when interpreting language.\n"

    "# Introduction to seq2seq\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models extend the power of LSTMs by organizing them into a larger **encoder–decoder** architecture capable of generating entire sequences of text. While LSTMs handle temporal dependencies within a sequence, seq2seq models specialize in transforming one sequence into another — often of different length and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where seq2seq Models Are Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Seq2seq architectures power many modern NLP systems, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)\n",
    "* Automatic text summarization\n",
    "* Chatbots and conversational agents\n",
    "* Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n",
    "* Speech recognition and transcription\n",
    "\n",
    "These applications require understanding an input sequence and producing a coherent, structured output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encoder–Decoder Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A seq2seq network is composed of two recurrent components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Encoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accepts the input sequence (text, audio, or video).\n",
    "* Processes each element step by step through an RNN (often an LSTM).\n",
    "* Discards the encoder’s final output matrix but **retains its final hidden state**.\n",
    "* This hidden state becomes a compressed representation — a fixed-length vector capturing the meaning of the entire input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Decoder**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Starts with the encoder’s final state as its initial state.\n",
    "* Generates tokens one at a time to form the output sequence.\n",
    "* During training, uses **teacher forcing**, where the correct previous token is supplied to help the model learn the next-token prediction more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teacher forcing trains the decoder to predict the next character or word in the target output sequence, given all previous correct tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why seq2seq Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Seq2seq models brought coherence and fluency to early neural text-generation systems by enabling networks to read an entire input, compress it into memory, and then reconstruct or transform it into a new sequence. They laid the groundwork for modern architectures such as attention-based seq2seq models and the Transformer.\n"

    "# Preprocessing for seq2seq\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with TensorFlow and Keras, the first major step is **preprocessing the text data**. This ensures that both the encoder (English) and decoder (Spanish) can operate on clean, tokenized sequences with appropriate vocabulary and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using TensorFlow and Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is accessed directly from TensorFlow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow import keras\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras provides high-level components for model building, making it well-suited for seq2seq architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Need to Prepare\n",
    "\n",
    "To train even a small English-to-Spanish translator, preprocessing must produce several key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Vocabulary Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "For both languages, we need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of all unique input tokens for English\n",
    "* A set of all unique target tokens for Spanish\n",
    "\n",
    "These vocabularies determine the dimensionality of the encoder and decoder input layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Token Counts**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total number of unique tokens\n",
    "* Used to define embedding sizes, one-hot encodings, or output layer dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Maximum Sentence Lengths**\n",
    "\n",
    "Models require fixed-length input sequences.\n",
    "We compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maximum input sentence length (English)\n",
    "* Maximum target sentence length (Spanish)\n",
    "\n",
    "These values control padding and ensure uniform tensor shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Marking Start and End of Target Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Seq2seq decoders must know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When to **start** generating text\n",
    "* When to **stop** generating text\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, each target sentence is wrapped with special tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prepend `<START>`\n",
    "* Append `<END>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Estoy feliz.\n",
    "→ <START> Estoy feliz. <END>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This teaches the decoder to begin generation at `<START>` and stop once it predicts `<END>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Noise Removal Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your goal, you may normalize:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Casing\n",
    "* Punctuation\n",
    "* Special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "For many applications, these details are not critical, and simplifying the text can improve model performance and reduce vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before Continuing\n",
    "\n",
    "You should examine the provided `script.py` and read each line closely. Understanding how text is loaded, tokenized, padded, and indexed will help you modify or extend the model later—for example, improving translation quality or adapting the system to new languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing pipeline sets the foundation for building the encoder–decoder architecture that powers seq2seq translation.\n"

    "# Training Setup (part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a seq2seq model, each sentence must be transformed into a numerical format that Keras and TensorFlow can understand. This is done using **one-hot vectors** within 3-dimensional matrices representing all training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a One-Hot Vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-hot vector represents a single token using zeros everywhere except the index of that token.\n",
    "Given the vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[\"the\", \"dog\", \"licked\", \"me\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-hot vector for **“dog”** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each token in the sentence gets its own one-hot vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why We Need Feature Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Before vectorizing the data, we must map each token to a numerical index.\n",
    "We create four dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **English features dictionary:** maps English tokens → indices\n",
    "* **Spanish features dictionary:** maps Spanish tokens → indices\n",
    "* **Reverse English dictionary:** maps indices → English tokens\n",
    "* **Reverse Spanish dictionary:** maps indices → Spanish tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "These mappings allow us to convert words into vectors, and later convert model predictions back into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Encoder Input Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the encoder input matrix using NumPy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "encoder_input_data = np.zeros(\n",
    "    (len(input_docs), max_encoder_seq_length, num_encoder_tokens),\n",
    "    dtype='float32')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breaking Down the Encoder Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The `encoder_input_data` matrix is filled with zeros initially. Its dimensions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of documents**\n",
    "   Each English sentence is one training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maximum encoder sequence length**\n",
    "   All English sentences are padded or shortened to match this length.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Number of encoder tokens**\n",
    "   The size of the English vocabulary, determining the length of each one-hot vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Float32?\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting `dtype='float32'` ensures efficient computation on modern hardware, especially GPUs. Although one-hot vectors contain only 0s and 1s, float32 allows smooth integration with TensorFlow operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup prepares the encoder data for the process of converting tokens into one-hot vectors that feed the LSTM.\n"
